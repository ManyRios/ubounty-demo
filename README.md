## 🎯 Why UBounty?

Most bounty platforms feel like paperwork. UBounty is different:

- **No signup** — just connect your wallet.
- **No escrow headaches** — funds are auto-locked via the [x402 protocol].
- **No delay** — bounties go live in seconds, not days.
- **No permission needed** — works with any public GitHub repo.
